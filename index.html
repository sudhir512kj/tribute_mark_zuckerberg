                                <li>
                                    <strong>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</strong> (born May 14, 1984) is an American computer programmer
                                    and Internet entrepreneur</li>
                                <li>He is a co-founder of Facebook, and currently operates as its chairman and chief executive
                                    officer.
                                </li>
                                <li>On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room.</li>
                                <li>A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service,
                                    created by Wayne Chang, was launched</li>
                                <li>On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Platform, a development platform for programmers
                                    to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been
                                    built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers
                                    around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.</li>
                                <li>In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the Internet.org project in late August 2013.
                                    Zuckerberg explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access
                                    to the 5 billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. Using a three-tier
                                    strategy, Internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to
                                    Zuckerberg
                                </li>
